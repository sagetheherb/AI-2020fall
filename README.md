## Course schedule
* Detailed course schedule is [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vRF6jdD5-whvlX-1mbKLpnryHVr8dIcKUbJcfg-Kx6WH7PkiXNRgLwyaQFO8svZWfxtaccjYpef0mpm/pubhtml?gid=0&single=true).

## General policies
* Keep yourself out of plagarism; Read [UMSL's Policy](https://www.umsl.edu/services/academic/policy/academic-dishonesty.html); Our `turnitin` tool automatically checks for plagarism; Here is an [example](supporting_files/turn-it-in.png) 
* Lecture recordings, audio or video, are not permitted
* You are welcome to bring your laptop in class

## Programming language
* Python3 is language for the course; you are expected to use Python3 for all of your classroom activities, homeworks, and project.
* You are also required to use [Google colab](https://colab.research.google.com) or your own hosted Jupyter Notebook for running your programs.

## ~~Late policy~~  
* You have a total of 5 late days.
* Once you use your late days, late submissions will get no points.

## Course project
* See [here](PROJECT.md).

## Classroom activities
* See [here](activities/README.md).

## Homeworks
* There will be two kinds of homeworks: 1) writing chapter summaries, and 2) project milestones.
* For chapter summary homeworks you will submit a one page summary (at least 500 words) of the chapter.
* All text must be "in your own words" and anything copied must be quoted and cited appropriately.
* For project homeworks, see the project section.

## ~~Tests~~
* There will be short tests (maximum 30 minutes) almost every week on Wednesdays (see the course schedule).
* If you miss a test (on topic A) and send me an email by the end of next day with a valid reason, your score in the next test (on topic B) will be copied as your score for the test you missed. However, in the test that you appear, you may be asked questions from both topics (A and B) while all others will receive questions only on topic B.
* Tests will be CLOSED book, CLOSED notes, and CLOSED electronics.
* Use of any type of electronics is strictly forbidden during tests.
* It is your responsibility to contact the instructor if you miss a test. If you don't, a grade of zero points will be assgined for the test you miss.

## ~~Attendance~~
* Attendance will be recorded frequently
* More than 5 uninformed absenses may lead to failing the course

## Grade composition  
* ~~10 * 3 points = 10 Tests~~
* ~~20 * 1 points = 20 Activities~~
* Before spring break:
  * 4 * 1 points = 4 Homeworks
  * 1 * 3 points = 1 Homework (learning how to learn online)
  * 3 * 3 points = 3 Tests
  * 10 * 1 points = Activities 1 through 12 [two optional activities for bonus] (before spring break)
  * 10 points = Project (phase I)
* After spring break:
  * 4 * 2 points = 4 Homeworks
  * 10 * 2 points = Activites 13 through 24 [two optional activities for bonus]
  * 30 points = Project (remaining phases)
* ~~1.5 bonus point to everyone who complete the course evaluation survey~~

#### Project (40 points)
* 10  points = Data analysis & preparation
* 10  points = Model selection & evaluation
* 5  points = Feature importance and reduction
* 5  points = Addressing peer-reviews
* 10 points = Final report ~~Poster presentation (score from external judges, peers, and instructor)~~

## Grading scheme  
* Unless you chose to be graded as S/U (given that the university allows it), following grading scheme will be used
